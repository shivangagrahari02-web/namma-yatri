# Namma Yatri Data Analysis

Client Background: 
Namma Yatri is a community-focused, zero-commission ride-hailing service application operating primarily in Karnataka, specifically Bengaluru and Mysore, serving as a direct competitor to major platform's like Rapido, Ola and Uber.
Namma Yatri maintains a public ‘Open Data’ dashboard that displays real-time analytics 24/7, including the number of trips, driver earnings and active searches. This public sharing of operational metrics is the direct inspiration of this project.

Project Overview: 
This project involves data analytics execution using Excel for data exploration, SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization. The workflow moves from querying raw data to understand the customer journey from the initial point search to final ride end and culminates in building an interactive dashboard. 

Key Objectives:
Analyze Users Funnel & Conversion
Operational KPI Tracking
Geospatial & Temporal Analysis
Visualizing KPIs and data views

User Journey Map:

Stage 1: Intent (Search)
The user opens the app and enters a Pickup point and a Drop-off point. This records that a user have expressed intent to travel between two points.

Stage 2: Evaluation (Estimated)
The user clicks Confirm Location to view the estimate of price. User may leave here if they find the estimated fare too high.

Stage 3: Commitment (Quote/Driver Search)
The user accepts the estimate and clicks Request Ride. The app begins searching for available drivers. This indicates the user is willing to pay the estimated price and is actively seeking a driver.

Stage 4: Assignment (Driver Found)
The system successfully matches the user with a driver, or a driver accepts the ride request. In high-traffic areas (like Bengaluru), users often drop-off here if no driver accepts the ride quickly.

Stage 5: Fulfillment (The Ride)
This stage involves three critical checks to ensure the ride actually happens:
Customer Commitment: Did the customer cancel?
Driver Commitment: Did the driver cancel?
Authentication (Start): The user gives the OTP to the driver to start the ride.

Stage 6: Completion (End ride)
The destination is reached and the driver marks the trips as Ended in the app. This is considered a Successful Trip. 

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

High-Level Volume Metrics:
Total Completed Trips: The total number of rides that were successfully  finished.
Total searches: The total number of times users opened the app and entered a From and To locations to check availability.
Total Estimates: The number of users who proceeded from the search screen to viewing the fare estimate.
Total Quotes: The number of users who accepted the estimate and actually requested a ride.

Efficiency Metrics:
Conversion Rate: The percentage of total searches that results in a successfully completed trip.
Search-to-Estimate Rate: The percentage of users who search for a location and  actually view the price.
Quote Acceptance Rate: The percentage of users who saw the estimate and proceeded to request a driver.

Financial & Operational Metrics:
Total Driver Earnings: The total amount of money earned by drivers
Average Fare per Trip: The average revenue generated per completed ride.
Average Distance per Trip: The average distance traveled per completed ride.

Quality Metrics:
Driver Cancellation Rate: The number of trips where the driver accepted the request but subsequently canceled.
Customer Cancellation Rate: The number of trips where the user requested a ride but canceled before it started.

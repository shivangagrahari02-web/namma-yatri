## Project Structure

This project is divided into three checkpoints:

### Checkpoint 1: Understanding Business Context and Defining Metrics

**Understand Business Context:**
Study the working model of Namma Yatri as a zero-commission ride-hailing platform and understand operational flow from user search to trip completion.

**Define Objectives:**
Analyze user behavior, demand patterns, and platform efficiency by studying the user journey and conversion funnel.

**Define Metrics:**
Identify key operational and business metrics required to measure platform performance.

**Key Metrics Include:**

* Total Searches
* Total Estimates
* Total Quotes
* Completed Trips
* Conversion Rate
* Driver Cancellation Rate
* Customer Cancellation Rate
* Average Fare per Trip
* Average Distance per Trip

**Metric Relationship (Funnel View):**
Search → Estimate → Quote → OTP Entered → End Ride

**Define Hypotheses:**

* Higher driver availability improves search-to-trip conversion.
* Delays in driver assignment increase user drop-off.
* High-demand locations experience higher cancellation rates.
* Mid-duration trips contribute most to platform revenue.

**Identify Data Columns:**
Select relevant columns from Trips and Trip Details tables to measure funnel stages, cancellations, and operational performance.

### Checkpoint 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Data Import:**
Import open-source trip data into Excel for initial exploration.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
Handle missing values, correct formats, and standardize fields for analysis.

**Data Processing:**
Create derived metrics such as conversion rate, average fare, and trip duration categories.

**Analysis:**

* Descriptive Statistics for searches, trips, distance, and fare.
* Funnel Analysis to identify drop-off stages.
* Location-wise and duration-wise demand analysis.
* Pivot Tables to analyze demand patterns and performance metrics.

**Data Visualization:**
Create visual representations to identify trends in demand, conversion, and operational efficiency.

### Checkpoint 3: Dashboard Development and Presentation

**Create Interactive Dashboards:**
Design Power BI dashboards showing key KPIs including conversion rate, peak duration, popular routes, payment methods, and operational metrics.

**Final Presentation:**
Summarize insights from EDA and visualization to explain platform performance and user behavior.

**Recommendations:**
Provide actionable suggestions such as improving driver allocation in high-demand zones, reducing assignment delays, and optimizing supply during peak durations.
